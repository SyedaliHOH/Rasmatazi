# Ratmatazi: Web-Pentest Framework for Organized and Effective Testing

## Description:

Ratmatazi is a versatile Web-Pentest Framework designed to streamline penetration testing, bug hunting, and vulnerability analysis. Its semi-manual approach ensures testers maintain control and purpose behind every request, avoiding the chaotic clutter of random automation results.

This tool focuses on generating commands based on widely adopted web methodologies, empowering testers to execute precise, goal-driven actions. By prioritizing clarity and organization, Ratmatazi makes it easier to conduct efficient and well-structured tests.

While Ratmatazi includes scripts and automation features, its primary mission is to serve as an organizational backbone for your web-pentest workflow. The degree of automation is entirely up to youâ€”customize templates to match your methodology and adapt the framework to your unique needs.

With Ratmatazi, testing is fast, clean, and methodical, helping you uncover critical vulnerabilities without missing a step.
